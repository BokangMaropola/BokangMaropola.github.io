					<p>You have to be crafty when you don't have a lot of money. My first PC was a second-hand XP machine which exploded, my second was a Lenovo desktop which was stolen in a break-in.</p>

									My third was a dumpster HP that had been thrown away, I salvaged a bunch of discarded DDR3 DIMMs and I was gifted a secondhand 250 GB hard drive. After assembling my mismatched parts, I tried to power it on and surprisingly it worked…<br/>
									or a week then it broke,<br/>
									and I tried to fix it but it exploded in my face (remember kids always unplug the computer while working on it).

					<p>One of the things I like about these types of games is the ability to make-believe. I'm not the most imaginative person so I enjoy the temporary detachment from reality.</p>

					<h3 id="mod">Modding</h3>
					<p>I once talked to a friend of mine and told him that my Skyrim is not like your Skyrim. He was playing Skyrim on the PlayStation 4 and I was playing on the Xbox One. The gall of me, to believe that my game had changed so drastically.</p>
					<h4>There's a mod for that</h4>
					<p>Now I play on PC where there are no limits.</p>

						My CK2 Mod<br/>
						The first time I created my own mod was in 2019, at the time I was playing Crusader Kings 2 and I decided to make it easier to cheat. Using a different mod I was able to read how bloodlines are created and then I created my own bloodlines mod. It took a lot of trial and error and usually didn't work but eventually, I had something I could use.
					</p>
					<p>
						My Skyrim mod<br/>
						In August 2023, I was frustrated because I couldn't find a patch that made two of my favourite mods work better together (Improved follower dialogue -Lydia and Bijin Warmaidens). Since I didn't want to get up either mod instead spent two days learning how to open ba files I learnt how to use x edit and how to use sseedit and created the IFD Lydia patch, two months after I made that patch the creator of ID created a similar page and killed my mod, kinda?<br/>

						I like all types of movies even though I don’t always have time to watch them. I prefer action and comedy but more than anything I like spectacle and cinematography. A good movie has excellent world-building and character work. If I had to recommend a movie I would suggest the indie movie El Hoyo aka the platform and my all-time favourite movie….

					<h3 id="favouritemovie">The World's End</h3>
					<p>This is my favourite movie, It is hilarious. The cinematography, storytelling, message and humour are on point even though it's 10 years old now the jokes and visuals have not aged.</p>
